## Installation Instructions
To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook. You can install the necessary libraries using pip

### Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_link>
```

Replace `<repository_link>` with the actual link to your repository.

## Usage Instructions
To execute the notebooks, you can use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

### Running in Jupyter Notebook
1. Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/repository
   ```
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. In the Jupyter interface, click on the notebook you want to run.

### Running in Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab in your web browser.
2. Click on "File" > "Upload notebook" to upload the notebook from your local machine.
3. Alternatively, you can open a notebook directly from GitHub by providing the repository link.
